# Decision-Tree-Regression-Implementation

# Introduction to Decision Tree Regression:
  A 1D regression with decision tree.
  The decision trees is used to fit a sine curve with addition noisy observation. As a result, it learns local linear regressions approximating the sine curve.
  We can see that if the maximum depth of the tree (controlled by the max_depth parameter) is set too high, the decision trees learn too fine details of the training data and learn from the noise, i.e. they overfit.

# Overview:
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Decision Tree Regression using Python. Decision Tree Regression is a non-linear regression technique that splits data into segments using tree-based rules, making it effective for capturing complex relationships in data.

# DataSet:
  The dataset used in this notebook consists of Petrol Comsumption data. The features and target variables are explored and preprocessed before training the model.

# Dependencies

  Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
  
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

  The key libraries used in the notebook include:
  NumPy: For numerical computations
  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  Matplotlib: For data visualization
  Scikit-learn: For implementing Decision Tree Regression

# Implementation Steps

  The notebook follows these steps:

  1. Importing Libraries: Load necessary Python libraries.
  2. Loading the Dataset: Read and explore the dataset.
  3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding if needed.
  4. Training the Model: Implement Decision Tree Regression using sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.
  5. Making Predictions: Use the trained model to predict results on test data.
  6. Visualizing the Results: Plot the decision tree regression modelâ€™s performance.

# How to Run the Notebook

  Clone this repository:

    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>

  Open the Jupyter Notebook:

  jupyter notebook DecisionTreeRegression.ipynb

  Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

# Results & Observations

  1. The model effectively captures non-linear relationships in the dataset.
  2. Decision Tree Regression performs well with structured data but may overfit if the tree depth is not controlled.
  3. Visualization helps in understanding how the model splits data.

# Future Improvements

  1. Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) using Grid Search.
  2. Compare Decision Tree Regression with other regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
  3. Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
